# Part 2
> By switching to this branch you can now see the next set of instructions!

### Merging
If a developer is working on a new feature in a branch and is ready to make it a part of the main project, they can merge their branch with the primary branch.

During a merge git will add all of the changes from one branch into another. Sometimes there will be conflicts in the merge but you will be prompted and allowed to choose which changes to keep.

For even more information about merging check out the official [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge).

## Instructions
